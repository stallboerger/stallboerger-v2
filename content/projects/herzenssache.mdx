Heart disease is widespread in Germany, with over 1.7 million patients hospitalized each year. This places a significant burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system. Yet, there is often a lack of understanding about diagnoses and treatments, which can negatively impact both the success of therapy and overall quality of life.

Herzenssache helps improve the understanding of heart disease by bridging the gap between medical professionals and patients. The concept includes two key components: a medical application for efficiently recording and visualizing diagnoses, diagnostic procedures, and treatment methods, as well as a patient application for personalized post-diagnosis support.

## Medical Application

The medical applications allows healthcare professionals to record and visualize cardiological results in a visually comprehensible way. This includes the ability to create and manage patient profiles, record diagnoses, and visualize diagnostic procedures and treatment methods.

## Patient Application

Patients can access their diagnoses through the personalized patient application. This includes a visual representation of their heart condition, as well as information about diagnostic procedures and treatment methods. This helps patients better understand their condition and treatment options, leading to improved therapy outcomes and quality of life.

## Tray System

Inspired by the fluid interactions in apps like [Craft](https://craft.do) and [Family](https://family.co), the tray system in the Herzenssache patient application offers an intuitive, flexible way to navigate complex medical information. Trays act as dynamic, modular panels that expand, collapse, or stack based on user interaction â€” providing quick access to key details without overwhelming the interface. Whether emerging from buttons or sliding in over content, the trays maintain context, helping patients explore their diagnoses, treatments, and progress seamlessly, keeping the experience both lightweight and empowering.
