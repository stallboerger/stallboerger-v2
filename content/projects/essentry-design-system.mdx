The essentry design system is a comprehensive design system that offers a consistent set of guidelines, components, and patterns. It is designed to help the team build products faster and more efficiently by providing a shared language and a collection of reusable components.

## Initial Challenge
  
The team faced an initial challenge: how do we create a design system that balances flexibility for new projects while ensuring a consistent user experience across established products? This required a deep understanding of both the design team’s workflows and the development team’s technical constraints.

## Building the System
  
To tackle this, I focused on structuring the system around key design principles: scalability, accessibility, and visual coherence. Each component was designed to be flexible yet maintain strict adherence to brand guidelines. I collaborated with designers and developers to define core components like buttons, inputs, and modals—ensuring they worked seamlessly across products.

## Guides

The design system includes guidelines for typography, color, spacing, and other design elements to ensure a consistent look and feel across all products.

## Interaction and Visual Design

To create a strong visual language, I designed interactive prototypes showcasing component behavior, transitions, and micro-interactions. These helped ensure the design system felt dynamic and engaging, rather than static templates. Each component’s behavior was documented and paired with Figma libraries and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) entries for developers.

## Collaboration and Implementation

A significant part of this project was fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration. I hosted regular design reviews, ensuring feedback from developers and product managers was integrated into the system. I also created detailed documentation to onboard new team members quickly.

## Impact

The new Essentry Design System accelerated product development timelines, reduced design inconsistencies, and empowered teams to prototype new ideas faster. It became a central source of truth, fostering collaboration across teams and supporting the company’s long-term product vision.
